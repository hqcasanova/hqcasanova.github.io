I have helped build a diverse set of large-scale <a aria-label=\"Wikipedia entry\"  data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page apps</a>: from a fully responsive <a aria-label=\"Work – Hevnly\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/hevnly\">online store</a> for a London-based startup to an <a aria-label=\"Work – CENtree\"  data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/centree\">ontology manager</a> for big pharma in Cambridge.

Expected personas ranged from the lab technician performing a single specific search to the biomedical scientist seeking relationships through serendipity. Given that both detailed control and simplicity were paramount, a progressive-reveal approach was adopted where specialist UI elements would be presented incrementally as the user progressed with their search. A prominent example of this was the search typeahead, whose rich interface was designed to allow two modes of search –entity and document– while avoiding cognitive overload as much as possible."

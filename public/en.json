      "Hi! I'm Hector, a <strong>frontend engineer</strong> with an academic background in scientific Java and over <strong>5 years</strong> of professional experience in the UK alone. I have helped build a diverse set of large-scale <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page apps</a>: from a fully responsive <a aria-label=\"Work – Hevnly\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/3\">online store</a> for a London-based startup to an <a aria-label=\"Work – CENtree\"  data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/1\">ontology manager</a> for big pharma in Cambridge. My current expertise is in <a aria-label=\"Wikipedia entry\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js\"><strong>Vue.js</strong>.</a>",
      "I'm a crafter that normally straddles the boundary between <strong>UX and code</strong>, acting as the link with the design team or product manager. My ultimate aim is to strike a balance between code complexity and user experience, letting the latter be the true driving force as much as possible. In essence, the big picture matters. That's why I love sweeping landscapes.",

All implemented in Vue JS to accommodate both discovery and specific user journeys while preserving simplicity. The target audience were scientists with a mixed technical background. Beyond CENtree, I also liaised with other groups within the company to align the identity and customer experience of all the apps in the SciBite ecosystem."

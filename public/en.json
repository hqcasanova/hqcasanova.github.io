I have helped build a diverse set of large-scale <a aria-label=\"Wikipedia entry\"  data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page apps</a>: from an <a aria-label=\"Work – Hevnly\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/hevnly\">e-commerce platform</a> for a London-based startup to an award-winning <a aria-label=\"Work – CENtree\"  data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"/work/centree\">ontology manager</a> for Big Pharma from scratch. My current expertise is in <a aria-label=\"GitHub repo\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"https://hqcasanova.github.io/pin-pad\"><strong>Vue.js</strong></a> but I've also dabbled in <a aria-label=\"GitHub repo\" data-cooltipz-dir=\"bottom\" href=\"https://github.com/hqcasanova/interactive-matcher\"><strong>Angular</strong></a>.",
      "I'm a crafter that normally straddles the boundary between <strong>UX and code</strong>, acting as the link with the design team. My ultimate aim is to strike a balance between feature complexity and user experience, letting the latter be the true driving force as much as possible. In essence, the big picture matters. That's why I love sweeping vistas.",

Expected personas ranged from the lab technician performing a single specific search to the biomedical scientist seeking relationships through serendipity. Given that both detailed control and simplicity were paramount, a progressive-reveal approach was adopted where specialist UI elements would be presented incrementally as the user progressed with their search. A prominent example of this was the search typeahead, whose rich interface was designed to allow two modes of search –entity and document– while avoiding cognitive overload as much as possible."

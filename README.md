Vue 3 responsive app using pure-CSS parallax to provide a brochure-like experience within the routing constraints of GitHub's environment. A challenge of sorts to see if I could produce the web equivalent of a leaflet from the point of view of human-computer interaction. The app is primarily designed to support IE Edge and the other major browsers [from 2016 onwards](.browserslistrc). Basically, anything that includes the [Proxy object](https://caniuse.com/proxy) should be fine, precisely the current requirement –as of May 2020– for Vue 3.

RESUME
======

This is my submission for the HTML/CSS assignment of Bitmaker Labs's Preparatory course. I decided to experiment with HTML5 and, while at it, code the page without a single line of JS and as if no cross-browser issues existed. For example, although I've tried to design it following the mobile-first philosophy, I've paid no attention at all at the existing limitations for fixed positioning. 

Given those boundary conditions, I wanted to see how much simpler the HTML and CSS would be nowadays. I'm sure it could be even simpler. So feel free to post any suggestions as issues. Constructive criticism is also welcome.
